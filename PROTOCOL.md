# KC Dev Worker Protocol

This file is the source of truth for messages exchanged between the Electron
main process and Chrome extension workers. The transport is a WebSocket bound
to localhost. All messages are JSON objects and must contain `type`.

## Connection lifecycle

- Endpoint: `ws://127.0.0.1:17890`.
- The Electron app binds only to `127.0.0.1`; the worker channel is not exposed
  to the local network.
- `REGISTER` must be the first worker message and must arrive within 5 seconds
  after the socket opens.
- The app keeps one active socket for each role. A newer valid registration for
  the same role replaces the older socket.
- The app sends `PING` every 20 seconds. The worker answers with `PONG` carrying
  the same `timestamp`. A connection with no message for 45 seconds is closed.
- A disconnected worker retries with exponential backoff capped at 15 seconds.
  A Chrome alarm also wakes the service worker every 30 seconds to recover when
  the desktop app was unavailable.

## Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `chat-worker` | Operate the ChatGPT tab and generate a scene timeline. |
| `flow-worker` | Operate Google Flow and generate images or videos. |

Only the role listed for an action may accept that action.

## Worker to app

### `REGISTER`

Sent immediately after a worker connects.

```json
{ "type": "REGISTER", "role": "chat-worker", "profileTag": "acc-chatgpt-1", "workerVersion": "2.13.1" }
```

- `role`: `chat-worker` or `flow-worker`.
- `profileTag`: stable local label for the Chrome profile. It must not contain
  credentials or a Google account identifier.
- `workerVersion`: extension manifest version used to reject stale workers for
  job actions while keeping connection diagnostics available.

### `PONG`

Response to `PING`.

```json
{ "type": "PONG", "timestamp": 1784000000000 }
```

`timestamp` echoes the value received in `PING`.

### `JOB_PROGRESS`

```json
{
  "type": "JOB_PROGRESS",
  "jobId": "scene-003-image",
  "status": "generating",
  "message": "Waiting for Google Flow",
  "heartbeat": true
}
```

- `status`: `queued`, `preparing`, `generating`, `downloading`, or `stopping`.
- `message`: optional human-readable detail.
- `heartbeat`: the extension sends a progress heartbeat every 5 seconds while an
  AI job is active. The desktop queue persists it and treats a silent job as
  stuck, then stops and retries it according to queue policy.

### `JOB_DONE`

Scene media jobs return a structured result:

```json
{
  "type": "JOB_DONE",
  "jobId": "scene-003-image",
  "result": {
    "sceneId": "scene-003",
    "mediaType": "image",
    "resultPath": "C:/Users/user/KC Auto Tool/scene_003.png"
  }
}
```

Timeline jobs return structured `result`:

```json
{
  "type": "JOB_DONE",
  "jobId": "timeline-001",
  "result": { "scenes": [] }
}
```

`result` is required and is validated against the original job payload.

### `JOB_ERROR`

```json
{
  "type": "JOB_ERROR",
  "jobId": "scene-003-image",
  "error": "Timed out while waiting for an image",
  "code": "TIMEOUT",
  "retryable": true
}
```

- `code`: `INVALID_JOB`, `WRONG_ROLE`, `NOT_LOGGED_IN`, `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`,
  `TIMEOUT`, `STOPPED`, `DOWNLOAD_FAILED`, or `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- `retryable`: whether retrying the same job may succeed without user action.

## App to worker

### `PING`

```json
{ "type": "PING", "timestamp": 1784000000000 }
```

### `JOB`

```json
{
  "type": "JOB",
  "jobId": "scene-003-image",
  "action": "GENERATE_IMAGE",
  "payload": {}
}
```

`jobId` is unique for the lifetime of the desktop app. A worker processes one
job at a time and must answer with one terminal `JOB_DONE` or `JOB_ERROR`.

### `STOP`

Stops the active job. Omitting `jobId` stops whichever job is active.

```json
{ "type": "STOP", "jobId": "scene-003-image" }
```

The worker reports `JOB_ERROR` with code `STOPPED` after cleanup.

## Job actions

### `GENERATE_TIMELINE`

Required role: `chat-worker`.

```json
{
  "srtText": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000\n...",
  "scriptText": "...",
  "graphicStyle": "Stickman, flat 2D illustration, white background, bold black outlines"
}
```

`graphicStyle` is optional user input. When non-empty, it overrides the style
returned by ChatGPT and is carried through the Visual Bible to every Google
Flow image prompt.

The result is:

```json
{
  "visualBible": {
    "style": "cinematic 3D animation",
    "palette": "teal shadows and warm gold accents",
    "lighting": "soft directional sunset light",
    "continuityNotes": "Keep recurring character designs and wardrobe unchanged",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9"
  },
  "scenes": []
}
```

The first ChatGPT batch derives the Visual Bible from the complete script.
Subsequent batches reuse it and return only their scenes; the worker joins all
batches into the final result above.

### `GENERATE_IMAGE`

Required role: `flow-worker`.

```json
{
  "sceneId": "scene-003",
  "mediaType": "image",
  "prompt": "Portrait of @ANCESTOR at sunrise",
  "characterTokens": ["@ANCESTOR"],
  "visualBible": {
    "style": "cinematic 3D",
    "palette": "teal and warm gold",
    "lighting": "soft sunset",
    "continuityNotes": "Keep wardrobe unchanged",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9"
  },
  "imageSettings": {
    "model": "nano-banana-pro",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9",
    "outputCount": 1,
    "expectedCredits": 0
  },
  "refImages": [
    {
      "token": "@ANCESTOR",
      "name": "The Ancestor",
      "mimeType": "image/png",
      "imageBase64": "iVBORw0KGgo...",
      "localPath": "C:/Users/user/KC Auto Tool/characters/ancestor.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

The desktop resolves the explicit `characterTokens` assignment against the
Phase 2 character library and attaches each selected image exactly once. Prompt
parsing is not used as the source of truth. An unknown assigned token rejects
the job before it reaches the worker. The Flow worker requires the Nano Banana
Pro option to show zero credits, uploads and verifies these references, compiles
the Visual Bible with the scene prompt, creates the image, downloads it to
`Downloads/KC Auto Tool`, and returns the absolute path.

### `GENERATE_VIDEO`

Required role: `flow-worker`.

```json
{
  "sceneId": "scene-003",
  "mediaType": "video",
  "prompt": "Slow camera movement"
}
```

Phase 4 validates the UI and real-time job lifecycle. Phase 6 adds the source
image and real video-generation implementation.

## Scene shape

```json
{
  "id": "scene-003",
  "order": 3,
  "timeStart": "00:00:08,000",
  "timeEnd": "00:00:08,000",
  "imagePrompt": "...",
  "imageStatus": "pending",
  "imageResultPath": "",
  "videoPrompt": "...",
  "videoStatus": "pending",
  "videoResultPath": "",
  "usedCharacterTokens": ["@ANCESTOR"],
  "characterPolicy": "selected",
  "assignedCharacterTokens": ["@ANCESTOR"]
}
```

Image and video statuses are `pending`, `generating`, `done`, or `error`.
